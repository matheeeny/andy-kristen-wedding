<h1>Potential Readings</h1>

<h2><strong><em>Song of the Open Road</em></strong> Walt Whitman</h2>

<pre><code>    Allons! the road is before us!
    It is safe-I have tried it-my own feet have tried it well.   

    Allons! be not detain'd!     
    Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen'd!  
    Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn'd!     
    Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!
    Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge expound the law.     

    Mon enfant! I give you my hand!  
    I give you my love, more precious than money,    
    I give you myself, before preaching or law;  
    Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me?
    Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?
</code></pre>

<h2><strong><em>The Book of Love</em></strong> The Magnetic Fields</h2>

<pre><code>    The book of love is long and boring
    No one can lift the damn thing
    It's full of charts and facts and figures
    and instructions for dancing

    But I, I love it when you read to me
    And you, you can read me anything

    The book of love has music in it
    In fact that's where music comes from
    Some of it is just transcendental
    Some of it is just really dumb

    But I, I love it when you sing to me
    And you you can sing me anything

    The book of love is long and boring
    And written very long ago
    It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes
    And things we're all too young to know

    But I, I love it when you give me things
    And you, you ought to give me wedding rings

    I, I love it when you give me things
    And you, you ought to give me wedding rings
